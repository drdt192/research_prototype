Instructions:

After downloading the file, Windows should warn you that this program is a virus, click more and run anyway (This is not a virus)

As you open the file, you should wait at maximum 1 minute and keep clicking the space bar on the console window to refresh it

As it was packaged using pyinstaller, it has to extract the dependencies into a temporary file, hence the delay.
